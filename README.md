# DSA-Statistics
Java project that demonstrates various sorting and searching algorithms. It includes implementations of popular sorting algorithms such as Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Bubble Sort. The project also provides implementations of linear and binary search algorithms.

The program reads a list of words from a text file and performs sorting and searching operations on the words. It measures the execution time of each algorithm and displays the results. The project serves as a practical example to understand the efficiency and behavior of different sorting and searching techniques.

Feel free to explore the code and run the tests to observe the performance of these algorithms in action. This project is suitable for educational purposes and can be a valuable resource for learning and studying sorting and searching algorithms in the context of computer science and data structures.
